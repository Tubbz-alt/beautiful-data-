Find here the analysis of the data for the experiment when an unconscious preference is happening in real time and a code to find biases in real time with the Epoc headset from EMOTIV.

I used the 14-channel Epoc but I guess you can use it with the Insight 5-channel too.   
For this experiment, I bought the software and rights to use.

The file bias-teller is the code to use to detect when a bias is happening in real time.
The rest of the files are the data is used and analyse.   

# Real time EEG with BCI Emotiv

Use this repo for reading in real time your brain waves with the use of the BCI Emotiv.
I used it to create a baseline in real time and then compare it to the readings. I found that the frequency F3 is related to unconscious preferences.
Basically, you could know when you are having an unconscious preference before knowing it.

## Getting Started
